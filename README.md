# CosineCreature

Currently it's an object that moves according to the firing rates of eight Izhikevich neurons that are simultaneously simulated in Python.
Each neuron has its corresponding base vector.
I named the project CosineCreature because it's inspired by the idea of cosine tuning of Motor Cortex.

Firing rates are updated every one second.
Unity and Python communicate with UDP.
